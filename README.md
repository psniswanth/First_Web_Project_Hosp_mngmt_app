# Hospital Management System

This is my first project in Web Development, built after learning the basics of Web and DBMS. [cite_start]The system includes three separate dashboards for the Admin, Doctors, and Patients[cite: 9]. [cite_start]The main feature is the appointment booking system, where doctors set their availability for the next 7 days and patients can book morning or evening slots accordingly[cite: 13, 20]. [cite_start]The application also supports secure login and the storage of patient medical records[cite: 10].

## Technologies Used
* [cite_start]Flask [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]SQLAlchemy [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]Jinja2 [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]Bootstrap 5 [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]SQLite [cite: 13]

## Key Learnings
* [cite_start]I learned how to create a database schema with relational tables like User, Department, and Appointments[cite: 15, 18].
* [cite_start]I understood how to use One-to-Many relationships to link doctors to departments and patients to their records[cite: 22, 23].
* [cite_start]I gained experience using the Python DateTime module to manage scheduling logic for morning and evening time slots[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]I learned how to build role-based access to ensure users only see the dashboard related to their specific role[cite: 10].
